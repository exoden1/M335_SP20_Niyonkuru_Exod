# Question :  How Has the Growth of the African Economy Been Over the Past 50 Years?

### A Look at the Gross Domestic Product(GDP), Real GDP (RGDP), and Real GDP per Capita, and GDP Per Capita

## Background 

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of an economy is a measure of total production. More precisely, it is the monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country or region in a specific time period (DataWorld.com)

Real gross domestic product is a macroeconomic statistic that measures the value of the goods and services produced by an economy in a specific period, adjusted for inflation. Essentially, it measures a country's total economic output, adjusted for price changes. Governments use both nominal and real GDP as metrics for analyzing economic growth and purchasing power over time. As such, real GDP provides a better basis for judging long-term national economic performance than nominal GDP(Gross Domestic Product). (Investopedia.com). 

## Objectives

A look at how the African Economy compares to that of the other continents. Developing insights on what should be done to boost the growth of the African economy.

## Graphs


```r
world <- read.csv("C:/Users/exoni/Downloads/FAOSTAT_data_7-18-2020 (1).csv")
growth_rate <- function(x)(x/lag(x)-1)*100 
world$growth_rate <- growth_rate(world$Value) 
w1 <- mutate(world,growth=growth_rate(Value),Value=Value/1000)
k1<-ggplot(w1,aes(x=Year,y=Value))+theme_bw()+geom_line(aes(y=Value),color="blue")+labs(title="World GDP per Year (1970-2018)",x="Periods",y="GDP in Thousands of Billion US Dollars")

## Summary and Recommendations


**As indicated in the graphs above, the continents whose GDP's are higher are those that excel in the manufacture domain. The African economy has been relying on the Agricultural sector. To see a boost in the GDP and overall African economy, there has to be an emphasis on the manifacturing sector.
In this study, I only chose to focus on areas that have a significant impact on GDP, Real GDP, and GDP per Capita. Other things held equal, a boost in the manufacture industry is likely to increase the GDP than Agriculture alone can do.**
